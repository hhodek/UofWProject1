1.	Are there trends in job satisfaction geographically? (the one I am answering)

    By province, there does not seem to be a trend in the data. This is reinforced by the bar graph of percent of satisfaction level responses by region. This is also reinforced by the fact that the test for normality leaves an abysmally low p-value, suggesting no significance of the presence of normality.

2.	Is there a correlation between gender and job satisfaction?
3.	Does age have an impact on job satisfaction?
4.	What do the provinces tell us about job satisfaction? (seems like a duplicate of the first one)
