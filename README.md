General Social Survey(GSS): Canadians at Work and Home
Data released - 11/14/17
- GSS surveys every 5 years
- GSS survey objectives are to gather data on trends to monitor changes in living conditions and well being, and provide information on specific social policy issues
- one eligible person (non-institutionalized person 15 years old or older) is randomly selected from sampled household
- Canadians at Work and Home survey in 2016 was the first time conductive; 50.8 response rate

Goal was to uncover trends in job satisfaction throughout Canada
We examined factors - geographically, gender and age group

36.11 million (2016) Canada Population

CONCLUSION
After data clean-up and review of analysis, we concluded that with the areas we focused on there were not discernable differences between Job Satisfaction responses.
We believe to further investigate job satisfaction, whether Canada or other countries geographies, we need to find additional data considering other factors.

Responses - data limitations
- several responses, when broken down by age group or geographically, were surpressed and accompanied in dataset by symbol "E: use with caution" or replaced by "F: too unreliable to be published".
- when rolled up to categories inclusive of all subgroups, some additional results were available
